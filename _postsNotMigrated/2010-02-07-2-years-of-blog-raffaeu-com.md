Today itâ€™s 2 years that I have opened my blog in English and itâ€™s two years that I moved to <a title="Bermuda Web Site" href="http://www.bermuda.com" rel="" target="_blank">Bermuda web site</a>.

I should do some considerations about it but itâ€™s not the right time for me so I will try to be as less negative as I can.

### Job and career.

I moved here 2 years ago as a Senior Software Developer working for a public Company as the IT Manager. In this company I was in charge of the entire (small) IT department. Unfortunately, after the Market Crisis of the 2009 I was â€˜convincedâ€™ to look for another job.

Actually I am working as a â€˜real software architectâ€™ for a pretty cool company also in the re-insurance business. In this company I am using all my knowledge (design architectures, .NET, latest technologies like WCF, WPF, WF) and I have also the luckiness to have the opportunity to mentor my colleagues with a weekly workshop. Trust me, for a community addicted like me itâ€™s a huge satisfaction!

I got some new Microsoft Certifications and I am working hard to gain the complete set of MCPD certifications too.

### Moving to <a title="Bermuda Web Site" href="http://www.bermuda.com" rel="" target="_blank">Bermuda web site</a>.

<a title="Bermuda Web Site" href="http://www.bermuda.com" rel="" target="_blank">Bermuda web site</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" target="_blank">small Island in the Atlantic Ocean</a>. The size is around 50Kmq and the population size is around 60,000 people, more or less.

After the â€˜first year honeymoonâ€™ the life starts to be really hard here.

Honestly, is not an easy place for a lot of reasons, especially for someone like me that is coming from one of the nicest place in the North of Italy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maggiore" target="_blank">the Lake Maggiore</a> and that likes a lot mountain activities like skiing and walking in the forest. What I miss in order of importance are:

  * Friends, friendship in Italy is **very different** than in any other country, trust me! <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/62126105-cd21-422a-b0d6-cbe182a102d9smiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" />
  * Food, also if me and my wife are **decent** cook, we still miss a lot of our traditional food here.
  * The environment. I miss the mountain, the snow, the lake and the quite winter we have in my town. I miss Milan and the shopping and I also miss the Switzerland where I spent the last 7 years.
  * NET Communities. Nothing like that in <a title="Bermuda Web Site" href="http://www.bermuda.com" rel="" target="_blank">Bermuda web site</a>, I also tried to open a workgroup a year ago but it seems to be a mission impossible.

Life is crazy expensive, just to give you a small idea, a normal rent is around 3, 4K a month and a decent dinner in a decent restaurant is around 150, 200 USD for two person. 

Fortunately, I have here all my family (my wife, my sweetie dog and my cat) so I feel comfortable and for now I still donâ€™t have the need to come back home; I also found some nice Italians friends that help me in the daily complains &#8230; <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/031904c3-f7a9-4685-9ac3-1227dca8c3fasmiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" />

### Personal.

When I moved here two years ago I started an awesome sport called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitesurf" target="_blank">â€˜Kite surfingâ€™</a>. Unfortunately, last year, I had a bad accident in Brazil, when I was on holiday with my wife, and I had a hernia surgery. After that I stopped to kite also because my wife wonâ€™t allow me to do that anymore.  <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/6f483b35-deaf-4348-924f-c2d9f82c10f1smiley-wink.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" />

The plan for this year is pretty ambitious but I wonâ€™t mention anything yet. I am just planning to write a lot, articles, online tutorials, book and more. Of course everything will be related to .NET 4.

My blog has now a small but really interesting average of 150 feed readers and an average of 200 visits per day with at least 1 daily feedback. Trust me, itâ€™s a huge satisfaction especially when your readers send you e-mail for business requests. <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/92810c57-73b9-4ce3-8f84-9b53a902898dsmiley-laughing.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" />
