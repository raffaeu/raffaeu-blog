During one of my tour around the City of Hamilton, Me and my wife we have found a really small and strange alley. Inside you can find any sort of strange shop.

I was really suggested about the paint made by a local painter here in Hamilton. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t remember the name but I can show you some of them, because I was able to stole some shots with my camera.

Take a look.

Really nice, is some sort of Na√Øf painting but with a Bermudan touch.

I love it, maybe I will buy one and I will hang in my Office.
