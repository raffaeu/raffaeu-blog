I have an exiting news today.

A couple of days ago, one of my friends <a href="www.community-credit.com" target="_blank">David Silverlight</a> asked me about a new project called Silverlight UserGroup Web Starter Kit. At the beginning I was afraid about the free time that I **do not have** but then I tough â€œthis should be a good way to learn RIA services and EF in depthâ€ â€¦

So here we go. This is the codeplex address: [http://silverlightugstarter.codeplex.com/](http://silverlightugstarter.codeplex.com/ "http://silverlightugstarter.codeplex.com/") and the project seems to be really cool, especially for the people that are going to work with me.

Oh boy, finally I can be part of a challenging project using Entity Framework, RIA services and C#.

Stay tuned!
