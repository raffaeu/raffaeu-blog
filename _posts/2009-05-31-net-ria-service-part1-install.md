In these series of posts I want to show how easy is to work with Visual Studio 2010, Silverlight 3 beta and the NET RIA Service.

#### Prerequisites and tutorials.

First of all we need to know what is NET RIA Service and how they can help us to write better business RIA applications.

NOTE: Unfortunately NET RIA will NOT work with the beta1 preview of Visual Studio 2010 so I recommend to use them into VS 2008 SP1.

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/03/19/what-is-net-ria-services.aspx" target="_blank">Brad Adams and NET RIA Service overview</a> has a very interesting post about the architecture of NET RIA Service.

Then, you must also watch the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/03/17/mix09-building-amazing-business-applications-with-silverlight-3.aspx" target="_blank">web cast at the MIX 2009</a>. This will give a real touch of this technology that I am loving!

After all, you need now to work with the NET RIA service. I am going to write a series of posts about that, but you can also follow the tutorials over the web.

In order to develop with Silverlight 3 beta you need:

  * Visual Studio 2008 SP1 or Visual Studio 2010 CTP 
  * <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=76bb3a07-3846-4564-b0c3-27972bcaabce&displaylang=en" target="_blank">NET RIA Services May 2009 preview</a> 
  * <a href="http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight3/default.aspx" target="_blank">Silverlight 3</a> runtime and toolkit 
  * Follow one of the <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/videocat.aspx?cat=12#sl3" target="_blank">numerous tutorial</a> available 

If you plan to work with Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2010, you can have a look also at my post on **<a href="http://blog.raffaeu.com/archive/2009/05/31/vmware-workstation-bridge-network-and-windows-7.aspx" target="_blank">How to RDP into a Windows 7 virtual machine</a>**.

After that you will be able to follow my tutorials.
