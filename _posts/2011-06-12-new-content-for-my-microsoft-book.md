The Microsoft’s book I have published few months ago: “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Applications-Presentation-Foundation-ViewModel/dp/0735650926/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307928213&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Building Enterprise Applications with WPF and MVVM</a>” has been a success but I still got some negative feedbacks that me and my editor we want to get rid off.

This book is my first **real** book and of course it was my first experience on writing a book (for this reason we kept the price of the book very low). Anyway .. I got some bad feedbacks about missing parts, parts not explained as expected and a misunderstanding of the book audience and target.

I personally believe that the biggest problem is in the title of book, it drives you a little bit out of the topic of the book, if you buy this book you will believe to get the “bible to LOB applications with MVVM”, which is not.

For this reasons and also to keep high the audience of the book, we have decided to deliver **for free** new additional content for the book! <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/958381da-5f11-4cf3-9b47-b40ebf2ac029wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png" />

The list of the new content is still under discussion with my editor but this is a rough list of the topics I will touch or expand in this new context that should be composed by 3 additional chapters!

  * Design patterns   
    I am planning to add 20/30 additional pages on the second chapter in order to exhaustively cover everything related to the most known design patterns
  * Advanced MVVM   
    I will add a new chapter where I will explain some “well known” problems you may find when the adoption of the MVVM pattern starts to get tricky!
  * Composite Frameworks for MVVM in practice   
    In this chapter we will build the same Master-Detail UI logic using the three most famous frameworks for WPF/Silverlight: PRISM, Caliburn and Light Toolkit

If you believe that the book is still missing other information, feel free to send me an e-mail and I will be glad to discuss this with my editor.

**Note:** Remember also that we are planning to distribute the source code of the book as an Open Source project on Codeplex.com before the end of the year. 

Hope this will help!
