It has been a long time since my last post, so I got some e-mails from my readers (really proud about it) wondering why I am not writing anymore on my blog.
  
Well you need to know what&#8217;s going on &#8230; It&#8217;s time for an update.
  
First of all I am very busy in the office, I am working hard right now and the time I come back home I am really tired. We had some busy week-ends here with bad weather, hurricane so I didn&#8217;t really have a lot of time for the blog.
  
Finally, probably the most amazing reason, I am writing a book!
  
Yes, you got it, all the tips and tricks I am sharing on this blog about WPF and MVVM will be available on a book before the end of the year. The writing process is almost done but as you can imagine that part is just a small part of the process.
  
As soon as I have few spare time I will be back on my posts. We will talk about the message broker and about some new feature available with Prism.
  
So, stay tuned!
