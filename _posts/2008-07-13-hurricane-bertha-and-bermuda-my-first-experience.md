As may People of you know, hurricane Bertha is coming really close to the east cost of Bermuda Island.

Today I have been to Sandy&#8217;s beach to play kite-surf, because with the hurricane that is coming, the wind is perfect **dangerous** to play this crazy sport.

In first I want to give you some information about Bertha. Bertha actually is a small Hurricane quoted 1, so the smallest in that category. Actually is really close to Bermuda and we can feel it by the wind that today is increased too much. Actually here the wind is around 30 knots, and tomorrow can grow a little bit.

In these link [Hurricane National Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) you can stay updated with all the information you need for every hurricane present in the world. The web site is updated every quarter and you can also subscribe to an RSS feed.

Another thing I want to let you know is about Bermuda and Hurricanes. Usually in the other Countries like United States, the Government activates every time a procedure of evacuation when an hurricane is coming. But you cannot do this in Bermuda. So you can stay really quite here, because the houses are built in case of an hurricane 5, and also all the Public services and Companies give you all the information and all the instruments to be safe.

Actually I cannot tell you more about it, but I will send another post in the next days to keep you updated.

For the moment I can only say to you that tomorrow I will go to play another time kite-surf, and enjoy the strong wind, otherwise I will come back in Italy with a direct free flight with my kite, using the power of Bertha. <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/424130f7-3e7e-4b85-b7f0-f1a0ba8dad2dsmiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" />
