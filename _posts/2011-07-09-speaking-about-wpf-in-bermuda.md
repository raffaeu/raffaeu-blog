Last year in Bermuda we had a new born, a NET community. The community has been created by some locals companies to attract developers, architects and analyst; but also anybody passionate of development.

You can check-out the web site here: <http://www.dnug.bm/>.

This month I will have the opportunity to present my two books:

  * <div align="left">
      <a href="http://www.apress.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=1430234709&submit=Go" target="_blank">Applied WPF in context (APRESS)</a>
    </div>

  * <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780735650923/" target="_blank">Build enterprise application with WPF and MVVM (MS PRESS)</a>

and to talk about WPF/Silverlight.

During this event I will explain what are the common problems you may encounter when moving from legacy applications to WPF/Silverlight. When you should and when you should not migrate an application to a new UI technology. When you should use WPF and when you should use Silverlight. Oh and I will also give some free copies of my books plus some additional discounts.

This is the page of the event: <http://www.dnug.bm/index.php?option=com_jevents&task=icalrepeat.detail&evid=5&Itemid=58&year=2011&month=07&day=21&title=july-2011-dot-net-user-group-event&uid=a620ff387a7449aaad68443c9780f7c2>

If you are planning a vacation around the 21st of July, please come here and join us in this first event about WPF/Silverlight.

Hope to see you there!

PS: I forgot to mention that one of the amazing price for the attendees is to win a 1 year subscription to MSDN.
