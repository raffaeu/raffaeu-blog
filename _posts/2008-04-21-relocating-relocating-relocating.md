I have the pleasure to inform you that, if Everything will be ok, starting from the next month, I will relocate with my family.

Now I'm working in Switzerland but I'm Italian and I live in Italy with my Wife and my sweet Dog.

Now in Italy there are a lot of problems, some about politics, some about cost of living and more .. So because I'm a IT Specialist (Microsoft) I have decided to try to relocate in a new place for a better life!

So stay tuned because starting from today I will share with you my experience and my trouble regarding relocating in a new Country!
