Finally it seems I have found a way to have a full day of 48 hours. To do that you can just remove some hours of sleep, the kite-surf and stay all night long logged into your computer.

As many of you know, I&#8217;m a NET Developer (more than that) and I&#8217;m member (not active anymore) of one of the most famous Italian NET Community (<http://blogs.ugidotnet.org>). Reading the other blogs, I noticed that I&#8217;m the only one who is still working with the junky old system called Windows Form 2.0. 

So, starting from today I will try to learn and use the amazing new framework released by Microsoft and called WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). In my blog I will try, as usually I do also for the other products, to share with you my experience using this product.

I hope everyone of you will have suggestions and idea to improve day by day my knowledge.
