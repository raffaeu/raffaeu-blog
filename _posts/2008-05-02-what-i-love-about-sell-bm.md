Some days ago, thanks to the Royal Gazette article, I have discovered [Sell.bm](http://www.sell.bm). 

This is a fantastic site for your small commerce activity. I&#8217;m a Microsoft Senior Dev and also a Database Admin so I can talk with knowledge about techical arguments. So I want to make some point of interest about technical properties of Sell.bm web portal and the reason because for me, you have to try to use it!

  * First one, very good search engine. You can make a really text search and obtain results of what you are searching. So you can make a reseach about arguments, types or by tiping a simple text.
  * Second, you can make an **order of the results!** Yeah, normally this is not possible but with the Sell.bm&#8217;s list items, you are able to do it!
  * Third I like so much that in my lists I can view soon the price and a snapshot of the item, so I&#8217;m not forced to open every item to view the photos and also know the price.

For this reasons, I want to give to Sell.bm a +10 for the usability. In the future I will try to use it in a more stressful way, and I will remake a new post about it.

Stay tuned!
