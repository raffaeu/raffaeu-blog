Ok my apologies to all my readers but Friday evening I have taken the flight for Hamilton Bermuda, and since today I had not Internet connection in the Guest House, so for me was impossible to write an updated post here.

Finally, I\`m here. Today is my first Job day and everything sounds good.   
Yesterday I had some time to spent to take a look around this fantastic Island and the only one thing I can say you is, take a look at my first Bermudian Photo>
