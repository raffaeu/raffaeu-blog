If you have a technical blog like me, one of the most frustrating thing is the ability to copy and paste well formatted code into your blog. I have found a lot of JavaScript plug-in but no one works as I want.

Today I have found on [windows live gallery](http://gallery.live.com) a cool plug-in for [windows live writer](http://gallery.live.com), [Code Snippet](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d4409446-af7f-42ec-aa20-78aa5bac4748&l=8).

This plug-in is written in C# and works very well with [Windows Live Writer](http://gallery.live.com) and [SubText](http://www.subtextproject.com/). I show you some example.

<a href="http://blog.raffaeu.com/images/blog_raffaeu_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CodeSnippetthebest_CF64/image.png" rel="lightbox"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="200" alt="image" src="http://blog.raffaeu.com/images/blog_raffaeu_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CodeSnippetthebest_CF64/image_thumb.png" width="260" border="0" /></a> 

As you can see from the previous picture, it&#8217;s a very useful plug-in for a NET blogger. You can:

  1. View different color for alternative lines and choose the color and the border line
  2. View the rows number
  3. Embed the CSS in the PRE tag or use your blog style

Cool Plug-in, in my opinion the best found on the web until today!!
