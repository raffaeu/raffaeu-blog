This post is an update for all the enquires I got about the source code for my MVVM book published few days ago. (Please follow this thread: [MVVM book](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/raffaeu/archive/2011/03/23/my-model-view-viewmodel-mvvm-is-out.aspx)).

The book was planned to be published for the first week of April 2011 but it was already published this week due to the high demand we received from the customers.

Unfortunately the source code of the demo application is under polishing process in these days and it will be available next week.

Please forgive me for this and stay tuned, I will update this post as soon as the source code will be released.

Thank you
