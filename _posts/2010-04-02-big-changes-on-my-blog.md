Hi everybody, I am writing this post to let you know that I am still alive and there are big changes coming in blog, soon. With soon I mean, probably, a couple of weeks.

The new version of <a href="http://www.subtextproject.com/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" target="_blank">Subtext</a>, my blog engine, may be out soon and it will include many futures. The best one will be a search index engine, it should be <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/lucene.net/" target="_blank">Lucene.NET</a>. In the meantime I am going to update my blog to the current available version, 2.1.2.

The second news is that my personal blog skin itâ€™s pretty close to be ready. I worked hard on it and I canâ€™t say anything yet but it will have an extensive use of the new <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> application framework plus a nice search capability. More than that it will allow me to display better my posts and my tutorials. More space for the code and more space for the comments. I will also introduce a stronger captcha comment validation due to the huge amount of spam that I am receiving everyday on my blog.

I am also preparing a new section on my blog skin where you will be able to view the tutorials by category. <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/0cd2ba34-15e5-47cb-94ed-fe5d1259398asmiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" />

I got a lot of emails in the last month about the <a href="http://prismtutorial.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Prism Tutorial project</a>, about the future of Entity Framework and also about an easy way for searching articles on my blog. Stay tuned guys, I am really working hard on it and you will have a nice surprise soon!

I want just to share with a preview of the amazing layout I came out for my new blog skin:

Update:

This is the final skin, in few days it will be ready for SubText.
