In this period, in principal the last week, I&#8217;m finishing my last job in Switzerland and I&#8217;m still waiting for my Temp Permit in Bermuda.
  
Yeah guys beleive me, this is the most worst period you can live!!
  
You still don&#8217;t know when you will relocate, but you cannot do anything.
  
You still don&#8217;t know the final date, but you are concious that your current job is finished, so you are unemployed!

Oh Man I really don&#8217;t like wait &#8230;
  
But It seems to be normal in BM. So I have to get used.
