In this period, in principal the last week, I'm finishing my last job in Switzerland and I'm still waiting for my Temp Permit in Bermuda.
Yeah guys beleive me, this is the most worst period you can live!!
You still don't know when you will relocate, but you cannot do anything.
You still don't know the final date, but you are concious that your current job is finished, so you are unemployed!

Oh Man I really don't like wait.
But It seems to be normal in BM. So I have to get used.
