I have received many queries about my first book on LOB applications so in this
          
post I will try to answer to most of them. Please forgive me in advance if I
          
can&#8217;t answer to all your queries.

  * Source code  
    Many of you are wondering why the source code of the demo
                  
    application for the MVVM book is &#8220;skinny&#8221; and why I didn&#8217;t provide a full
                  
    working application.  
    The book has been released and the work behind it is
                  
    huge. This book is supposed to be a guideline for a senior developer on how to
                  
    architect a LOB application so in my opinion it was not necessary to provide all
                  
    the code required to make a fully working application. I mean the application
                  
    works but I left the &#8220;finishing touch&#8221; to the reader. Anyway, due to the high
                  
    demand, I will work on this and during the summer I will post new versions of
                  
    the app probably on CodePlex so that I can be an Open Source project where each
                  
    dev interested can put some effort on it.
  * APRESS WPF Book vs MS MVVM book  
    Why Raf wrote two books and not one? First
                  
    let me say that Microsoft and APRESS are two separated
                  
    companies; my &#8220;MVVM&#8221; book has been published by Oreilly for Microsoft Press
                  
    while my APRESS book will be published by APRESS &#8230; The first one talks about
                  
    &#8220;Architecting a LOB application and the MVVM pattern&#8221; while the second one
                  
    &#8220;teach you from scratch a layered WPF application&#8221;. If you want a reference to
                  
    layer an application you have to buy the first book, <span class="style2"><br /> especially if you are new to the topic (layering)</span>, if you want to learn: WPF,
                  
    MVVM, Entity Framework, threading on WPF and more you have to buy the second
                  
    one, event if you are a middle expert WPF developer.

I do not like to blown my own trumpet and who has worked with me can confirm
          
that, but, if you are interested in learning WPF and learning how to architect a
          
LOB application you have to buy both books as just one will not cover all the
          
topics you need to master this technology. I would personally buy the MS PRESS
          
book, read it once, then buy the APRESS WPF book, read it and build the sample
          
application, then read again the MS PRESS one.

Â The final note is about the comments. The book is on Amazon.com and OReilly.com
          
and as an author I would kindly appreciate if you can post a comment that
          
explains what you liked and what you didn&#8217;t like about the books. Posting a
          
comment with 2 stars saying &#8220;the source code is not available&#8221; while it is on
          
OReilly.com, it is just silly and doesn&#8217;t help anybody &#8230; If you have a problem
          
with the source code, feel to contact me, even if you disagree with some of my
          
ideas exposed in my books. I have a wide open mentality and I love to have
          
&#8220;constructive discussions&#8221; with my readers.
