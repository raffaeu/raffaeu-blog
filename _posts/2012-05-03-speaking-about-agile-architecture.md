The 9th of May 2012 at 2 p.m. (GMT +1) I will speak about Agile Architecture. The webinar will be registered and hosted by <a href="http://www.typemock.com/" target="_blank">Typemock</a>.

This is the address to register: <https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/427749090>

Below is the Agenda and you are still in time to add some little changes:

**What is Software Architecture**   
• What is Agile development   
• How they can live together?   
**Discover principles of Agile architecture**   
• Lifecycle and process   
• Modeling and development   
• The right solution for the right problem   
• How to deliver quality with (TDD)

If you want to listen about this topic or more feel free to drop me an e-mail (_using my blog contact form_) and I will be more than glad to expand it during the webinar. Of course it has to be something related to Agile Architecture … <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1a77486d-6b6b-463e-bbe7-6ffafdb7480cwlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png" />

If you want to read more about it I would suggest you the following articles:
