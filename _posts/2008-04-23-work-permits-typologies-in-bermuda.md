During this days I see a lot of People asking in the forums, &#8220;What kind of work permits Bermuda government release?&#8221;, so I have decided to help you and give you a little brief regarding actual Bermuda&#8217;s work permits.

### Typologies.

#### Part-Time Permit : 

A Part-time permit, allows a person (_who is still resident in Bermuda!!I)_ to work no more than 9 hours a week, also if the person isÂ  a tutor or something like that.

The application is around 293.00 $ (BSD).

#### Temporary Permit : 

This kind of permit allow a person to be employed for a specific job, for no more than 3 months. In this case the person is considered like a visitor for Bermuda Government and there is no need to provide immigration questionnaire, x-ray chest and so on &#8230;

In this case that person can renew the work permit (by a request from the employer) only one time, for a maximum of total 6 months.

The application is around 293.00 $ (BSD).

#### Long Term Permit : (one year)

There are a lot of Long Term permits released by Bermuda Government, the first one is the classic one year work permit. If the person has to work for a period less than 18 months this is the right work permit.

The application is 587.00 $.

#### Long Term Permit : (more than one year &#8230;)

Ok I don&#8217;t want to explain all the kind of Long Term Work Permit. You have to know that there are a lot of, every one is distinguished by the period time of lease.
