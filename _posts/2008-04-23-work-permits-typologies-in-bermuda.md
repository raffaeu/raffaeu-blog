During this days I see a lot of People asking in the forums. What kind of work permits Bermuda government release?, so I have decided to help you and give you a little brief regarding actual Bermuda's work permits.

# Typologies

## Part-Time Permit

A Part-time permit, allows a person (_who is still resident in Bermuda!!I)_ to work no more than 9 hours a week, also if the person isÂ  a tutor or something like that.

The application is around 293.00 $ (BSD).

## Temporary Permit

This kind of permit allow a person to be employed for a specific job, for no more than 3 months. In this case the person is considered like a visitor for Bermuda Government and there is no need to provide immigration questionnaire, x-ray chest and so on.

In this case that person can renew the work permit (by a request from the employer) only one time, for a maximum of total 6 months.

The application is around 293.00 $ (BSD).

## Long Term Permit

There are a lot of Long Term permits released by Bermuda Government, the first one is the classic one year work permit. If the person has to work for a period less than 18 months this is the right work permit.

The application is 587.00 $.

## Long Term Permit : (more than one year.)

Ok I don't want to explain all the kind of Long Term Work Permit. You have to know that there are a lot of, every one is distinguished by the period time of lease.
So check the table under there:
