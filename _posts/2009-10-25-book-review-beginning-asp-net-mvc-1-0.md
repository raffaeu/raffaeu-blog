A dear friend of mine, <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/" target="_blank">Simone Chiaretta</a>, <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=4CEB87C3-2257-408D-AABB-7956CB3E1349" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVP</a> wrote an interesting book about ASP.NET MVC in collaboration with [Keyvan Nayyeri](http://nayyeri.net/).

[<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blog.raffaeu.com/Images/blog_raffaeu_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BookreviewBeginningASP.NETMVC1.0_B45F/image.png" width="148" height="180" />](http://codeclimber.net.nz/) 

The book is **Beginning ASP.NET MVC 1.0**, edited by Wrox, available on Amazon.com at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047043399X?ie=UTF8&tag=codec04-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=047043399X" target="_blank">this address</a> for the price of 31.49 USD.

I am going to write a review of this book because, first of all, I know Simone and his professionalism. Second, because I am working now on an ASP.NET MVC project in my company, and this book was really helpful for me, so I am pretty sure that it will be the same for you guys. 

### Summary and structure of the book.

The book has 19 chapters plus a couple of appendixes. Each chapter covers a specific argument. At the end of each chapter there is always a section for the exercises and a summary section. The first thing you will like about this book is **<u>the huge amount of sample code!</u>**

At the end of the book there is the appendix B that contains all the solutions related to each exercise, so you wonâ€™t get lost.

The appendix A has a lot of useful links that you can follow, resources, links, books and more.

Finally there is the index that is done for a â€œdevâ€ reader. Itâ€™s not a normal index but an index divided by alphabetic order that includes also all those components and â€œcodeâ€ that you will find in the book. So you will find, for example, the page that talks about â€œNHibernateâ€.

### Case studies.

What I really liked about this book is the 2 case studies that you will find at the end. Simone has created these 2 case studies that will reflect 2 real solutions, one is a blog and the second one is â€¦ a surprise. I am not going to tell you everything because you **must** buy it. <img src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/b1ab95e9-9c2f-4e36-b231-473b203a1eecsmiley-wink.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" />

This is something really well done as you will apply all the knowledge you got through the book into 2 real solutions!

### Chapters.

Of course I am not going to describe each chapter, but this is the list of chapters so you can understand why this book is so well done, IMHO:

  1. MVC pattern 
  2. WebForm VS MVC 
  3. Getting started 
  4. The model 
  5. The controller 
  6. The view 
  7. Routing 
  8. Unite test concepts 
  9. Testing ASP.NET MVC 
 10. Components 
 11. Action filters 
 12. AJAX 
 13. Deployment 
 14. Leveraging ASP.NET WebForm futures 
 15. Authentication and authorization 
 16. Extend ASP.NET MVC 
 17. Migrating from ASP.NET 
 18. Case studies 
 19. Resources 
 20. Exercises solutions 

### Final Considerations.

I am a NET developer, most of time I develop Silverlight/WPF or WinForm applications. For fun I did a couple of ASP.NET MVC applications in the bank where I was working before, but my knowledge about ASP.NET MVC was relative to those projects.

Now that I got this book, I was able to read all the aspect of MVC pattern applied to ASP.NET and I feel comfortable to build a real application with this framework.

I did a real ASP.NET MVC application for the Company where I am working now, and I was able to do everything is less than 1 week, including the use of JQuery and AJAX.

I am really satisfied of this book and I hope that you will buy it as it is a very nice and well written book that will drive you inside this pretty cool framework.

Thanks Simone and Keyyvan for your effort!
