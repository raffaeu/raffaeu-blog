This sentence should not be misunderstood. I&#8217;m not back to Italy but I can finally say **_I&#8217;m back to my blog_**.

In these last months I was and I&#8217;m still a little bit busy. Working on a new system I designed with MS SQL 2008 and Reporting Services with Integration Services has keep me busy for the last 3-4 months.

But the plan for the 2009 has changed!!

My objectives for this year are 3:

  1. Complete my Certifications on SQL Server and complete the MCPD.  
    I want to close this chapter of my professional life, I must complete my Certifications this year! No excuses!
  2. Enrich my blog with my experience in Team Management and in SQL Server. This year in <a title="Bermuda Web Site" href="http://www.bermuda.com" rel="" target="_blank">Bermuda web site</a> was very positive and productive for my skill and I want to share what I learned with you. I promise I will!
  3. Take a look around and try to understand if I can start something for me. I still don&#8217;t know what, well I have some ideas &#8230; but it&#8217;s too early now to **_publish_** what has to be secret, top-secret!

For the rest I really hope to have back my readers and to have back also your comments, I live for those!!

**_Have a nice day &#8230;_**
