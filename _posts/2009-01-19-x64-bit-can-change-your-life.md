A couple of months ago, I have installed a Windows server 2003 R2 x64 Enterprise with SQL Server 2008 x64 Standard with all the services and I was very surprised about the performance.

After a while, I have prepared another server with TFS and Windows 2008 in x64 version, with Office Sharepoint x64, and WOW, the performance were really great!!

Now, I just spent the last week-end installing Windows Vista Ultimate SP1 x64 on a mobile Intel Core Duo 2, and &#8230; my god! You can really taste the powerful of Vista and Office 2007. Great performance, fast process and never lock down.

So the point of my post is:

**_If you have a machine that can run an O.S. in a x64 mode, do it, right now. Change the O.S. and move to the x64 version, you will really increase your power!_**

My only disappointment is about **Office 2007**. I think it&#8217;s a real great product, but I would like to know why Microsoft didn&#8217;t create a full x64 version. The U.I is heavy and it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to run a x32 application in a x64 O.S.

Rumors say that the new version of Office will be full x64 compatible, we will see!!

For the moment I&#8217;m going to install Windows 7 x64 in my Personal Laptop.. I&#8217;m really excited.
