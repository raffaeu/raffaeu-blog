During the last two months I have been away from Bermuda and I didn’t have a lot of time to write or post any news on this blog.

In the meantime, I didn’t realize that my new book from APRESS: <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430234708" target="_blank">“Applied WPF 4 in context”</a> has been published so it is time to post some info about it.

The cover of the book is following the APRESS new style and it is the following one:

[<img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="APRESS_cover" border="0" alt="APRESS_cover" src="http://raffaeu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/b225dc5d-7a75-4b56-9bbd-5ebd19839cfeAPRESS_cover_3.png" width="210" height="260" />](http://www.apress.com/9781430234708)

The new series “applied in context” of APRESS deliver content by example and practical code, so in this book you will realize a full working WPF 4 application using all the available tools of Microsoft like: Visual Studio 2010, Expression Blend 4 and SQL Server 2008 R2.

### Who this book is for?

This book is for Windows application developers who want to understand the context in which WPF sits and the standards and best practices that can be employed to improve the efficiency and maintainability of their projects. This book can be used by a junior developer to learn WPF and understand how to architect a layered application, and it can be used also by a senior developer as a reference for developing scalable WPF applications.

### Table of content.

Following is the table of content of the book:

  1. Introducing WPF and XAML 
  2. Sample Application: Overview and Getting Started 
  3. Microsoft Expression Blend 
  4. Creating the Views 
  5. Adding Controls to the Views 
  6. The Entity Framework 
  7. Data Binding 
  8. Command Handling and Event Routing 
  9. Testing with TDD    
 10. Reports with Microsoft Reporting Services 
 11. Deploying the Application Using ClickOnce 
 12. Design Patterns in WPF 
 13. WPF and Multi-Threading 
 14. Interacting with WCF

### Distributors.

The book is released and published by APRESS so in this case the book can be bought from the APRESS web site or from one of their distributors. Right now, Amazon has already run out of copies so you should expect the next distribution starting the 7th of June for the Paperback copy. You can still download the e-book from Amazon.com or APRESS. I am not sure I will distribute this book also with Kindle as I had some issues with the previous one so for now it won’t be available directly in the Kindle web site or in the iBook application for iPad.

Right now you can buy the book here:

  * APRESS web site: <http://www.apress.com/9781430234708>
  * AMAZON.com web site: <http://tinyurl.com/6bd4v2b> 
  * Safari online: <http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/-/9781430234708>
  * Barns & Nobles: <http://tinyurl.com/4xmzbup> 

The are also other distributors that I do not personally follow but I believe that buying the book directly from APRESS will give you the best price/availability options.

### Prices.

This is the list of the **official prices**, if you find the book with a different price from a different distributor than the one listed in the previous section **I am not aware** about it, so please let me know if you believe someone is distributing the book with a **non fair price**.

Print version with shipment from APRESS including TAX: 49.99 USD

E-book version from APRESS including TAX: 34.99 USD
