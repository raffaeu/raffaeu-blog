My friend [Simone Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/default.aspx "Simone Chiaretta") is writing his first book about **Beginning ASP.NET MVC** in collaboration with [Keyvan](http://nayyeri.net/).

The book will be targeted to the developers that are not really focused on the MVC framework. This framework is new in Microsoft and it is still in a Beta version but personally, I&#8217;m using it and I have used this framework for two web project and it&#8217;s awesome!!

You can find a detailed series of articles about ASP.NET MVC, written by Simone on [DotNetSlackers](http://dotnetslackers.com/). I suggest to everybody to read them.

If you wanna read more details about the book, the Publishing date and related stuff, you can go directly to [Simone weblog](http://codeclimber.net.nz/default.aspx) and read [his post about](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2008/08/13/aspnet-mvc-book-wrox.aspx), or go to Keyvan weblog and read [his post about](http://nayyeri.net/blog/our-new-book-ndash-beginning-asp.net-mvc/).

Enjoy!!
