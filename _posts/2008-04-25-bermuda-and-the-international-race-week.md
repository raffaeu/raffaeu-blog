I have read in the blog of [my friend](http://tomquinn.blogspot.com/2008/04/danger-men-boating.html) (Tom Quinn) that this week It will start a new interesting event, for me, the annual [Bermuda International Race Week](http://www.rbyc.bm/biirw2008/Home/tabid/505/Default.aspx).

In this event you can see old and new crews make competitions on the fantastic Bermuda sea!

What a Pleasure for my friend [Simone](http://codeclimber.net.nz/), he loves so much to sail!

I have also founded some nice shot here:
