Good morning everybody, first of all I want to apologize for my absence in December. I am really sorry but I was â€˜tryingâ€™ to deliver a component in my office and I was so busy and tired that I didnâ€™t have time for the blog.

Letâ€™s start this â€˜holidayâ€™ posts with an interesting review of a software architecture book written by two friends of mine: <a href="http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/pape/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Andrea Salatarello</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/" target="_blank">Dino Esposito</a>.

<a href="http://blog.raffaeu.com/Images/blog_raffaeu_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BookReviewArchitectingapplicationforthe_AE66/image.png" rel="lightbox"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blog.raffaeu.com/Images/blog_raffaeu_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BookReviewArchitectingapplicationforthe_AE66/image_thumb.png" width="221" height="260" /></a> 

The title is: **Microsoft .NET: Architecting Applications for the Enterprise (PRO-Developer) (Paperback)** available at Amazon.com for 29.69 USD.

### Chapters and sections.

The book is divided in 2 main sections: Principles and Design of the system.   
The <u>principles</u> section talks about the architect and the architectures in software development. The <u>design of the system</u> talks about how the application should be architected and developed.

The first part has these chapters:

  * Architects and architecture today
  * UML essentials
  * Design principles and patterns

And the second one has the following:

  * The business layer
  * The service layer
  * The Data access layer
  * The presentation layer

### Description and overall.

This is the description provided on the back of the book and I completely agree with it.

> â€œMake the right architectural decision up front â€“ and improve the quality and reliability of your results. â€¦ you will learn how to apply the patterns and the techniques that help control project complexity â€¦â€

I am 100% satisfy of this book as I already use these patterns and approachesÂ  explained in depth in the book. 

Itâ€™s a must to have for senior developers and software architects. You canâ€™t miss it!!   
First of all, this is the first book I have read where is explained in depth what is a Software Architect and why his role itâ€™s fundamental in the development of a complex application. Second, it explains in depth the different approaches you may use for the various layer of an application, starting from the DBMS ending with the UI.

I wish any developer that works or will work with me, will read this book as it gives you a complete overview on how an application should be developed and when a particular layer should or should not be used. 

There is also a complete <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NSK" target="_blank">open source project (NSK)</a> on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com" target="_blank">codeplex</a> where you can see all the patterns and methodologies explained in this book. Of course, opening the Visual Studio solution and try to understand everything is not easy as it is using this **awesome** book.

I am really satisfy and happy! Thanks Andrea and Dino for your effort!
