This year is a new year for me for everything, why?

New location (Bermuda), new job (IT Manager) and new technologies (no more NET dev but SQL Dev). So why don&#8217;t put in my life another new interest in different certifications? I have decided to became a MCITP (Microsoft Certified IT Professional). [Here you can find](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcitp/default.mspx) a detailed description of all the seminaries.

For MS SQL 2005 there are 3 ways. All the ways have the same startup. [Exam 70-431](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-431.mspx)Â  TS: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 â€“ Implementation and Maintenance. With this exam you gain the MCTS SQL 2005. Now you can choose one of the three available profiles.

**MCTIP Database Developer.   
** Microsoft Certified IT Professional: Database Developer certification demonstrates that you can design a secure, stable, enterprise database solution by using Microsoft SQL Server 2005.

** Microsoft Certified IT Professional: Business Intelligence Developer certification demonstrates that you can design analysis solutions, data transformations, and reports. Business intelligence developers design and implement multi-dimensional database models (logical and physical), data marts, data warehousing, data transforms, data analytics, and reporting solutions. This includes programming and customizing servers that use Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), customer transforms, and custom reporting solutions. Business intelligence developers are typically employed by medium-sized to large organizations.

I would like to get in first step the Database Administrator, that is the most hard to get. And in a second time I will start with the Database Developer. But if I have to honest what I love is the ETL process, so for me the dream is to get also the complete knowledge of how to build a strong Data warehouse.

Starting from now stay tuned because I will post a lot of info about SQL.
