Today in Switzerland is my last workly day.

I have made a little party this morning and I have received two fantastic gadgets from my former collegues.

The first one, It's a fantastic Camera, the **Casio Exlim S10**, bottom here you can find a shot of:

The second one It's a classic Swizerland gift, the myth of Victorinox, a useful small knife.
