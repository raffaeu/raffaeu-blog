Today in Switzerland is my last workly day.
  
I have made a little party this morning and I have received two fantastic gadgets from my former collegues.
  
The first one, It&#8217;s a fantastic Camera, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casio Exlim S10</span>, bottom here you can find a shot of:
