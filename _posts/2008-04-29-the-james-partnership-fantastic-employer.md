I have to say a special tanks to Marie, a fantastic girl who keep me during this difficult process to find, discuss and obtain a job in Bermuda. She is very professional, skilled, and also very kind. I have stressed so much Marie for a lot of reasons (Question about relocation, salary, contract and more ...) but she was always kind and precise with me. Very good!
