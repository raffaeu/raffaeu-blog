As many of you know, I&#8217;m Italian and I&#8217;m relocated in Bermuda.

So I want to talk about the experience of obtain a work permit (temporary, for only 3 months) in Bermuda and what&#8217;s happen here in Italy!

In Bermuda you MUST have a work before ask for a work permit and also, you CANNOT ask for it, but your employer must ask for you. In my opinion, this is a very correct procedure, because in this way, Bermuda Government is able to control the Immigration flow. Very good.

What&#8217;s happen in Italy? In Italy many people from Africa and also from the South of Europe, come in without a work permit, but as a tourists, or completely illegal. After they are not able to find a job, because they have not a regular work permit for the Italy Government. So what&#8217;s happen? They MUST get money with illegal activities, like sell drugs, prostitution and more &#8230; So my question is?

Why Italian Government doesn&#8217;t learn from Bermuda Government? Maybe here in Italy we may have less criminality and much more &#8216;Clean&#8217; People.

Another question is, Bermuda is a very small Island with a lot of Immigrant people, but they are able to leave a Work Permit in only 2 weeks!! This is fantastic because this mean that in Bermuda Office everyone make her job correctly and efficiently. 

The same problem in Italy is not solvable. For example: I have a friend of mine that comes from Africa, and every year he has to go on the Italian Immigration Office and wait a lot of days, yeah a lot of days, on the street to take his turn to the office. So in those days you can find a lot of immigrant, sleep over the road and wait only to give a document to the Immigration office.

These two reasons make me very happy because now I&#8217;m in bermuda and I can stay in a more efficient Institutional Machine.
