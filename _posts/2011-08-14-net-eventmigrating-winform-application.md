Last month (21st of July 2011) I spoke at the Bermuda NET Event “Migrating WinForm applications to WPF/Silverlight”. This has been for me the first NET Event in Bermuda but for sure it will not be the last one. We are planning to have a new event this autumn where we will touch other topics like: ALM, Parallels and more.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alessio.bellisomi" target="_blank">Alessio Bellisomi</a>, the web developer that works in my company, I am able to share with you some nice pictures of the event and three short movie of the event. Unfortunately, for this event, we were not super organized so I do not have with me the full video of the entire event. I promise that for the next event we will provide the entire video and maybe we will be also able to stream the content.

The audience, considering that we were in Bermuda and considering that it was end of July, was more than expected. I believe we were around a 30/40 ish attendees. The feedback has been really positive and we expect a very fast grow of this UserGroup by having more events and more speakers.
